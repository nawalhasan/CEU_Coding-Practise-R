```{r}
library(kableExtra)
```

# Aim

In this project I am practising RMD features

# Theme 

To change the theme of the document I am using 


# Codes

I include a code chunk with a comment in it.

```{r, echo=F}
print("I am the comment")
```
I also say hello to thr world with print() and for that I am only showing the output of the code.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("hello world")
```

# Tables

With kableExtra I show the first 5 rows of the Chickweight dataset. For this I will use the 

```{r, echo=F}
ChickWeight[1:5,] %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_classic(full_width=F)
```
